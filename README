Add Tables in Etherpad-Lite
---------------------------

Initial project (but dead & broken) from Gideon (https://github.com/gedion/ep_tables)
I decided to take over and improve it.

The plugin is available in English & French for now.
If you want another language, take the locales/en.json file and translate it (it's not big).

Export the tables:
It only works with Html export.
Text & Dokuwiki exports don't have a hook for me to handle the formatting.
Other exports from others plugins must manage it in their code, but I'll gladly help if they contact me.
